This project implements a real-time hand sign detection system using OpenCV, cvzone, and a pre-trained Keras classification model. The system captures hand gestures via webcam, processes them into a fixed-size image, and classifies them into predefined labels such as Hello, Yes, No, Thank You, and more.

The goal is to bridge communication between sign language users and others by providing instant gesture recognition
